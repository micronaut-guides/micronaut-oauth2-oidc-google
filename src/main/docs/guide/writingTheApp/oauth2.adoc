Visit https://console.developers.google.com[https://console.developers.google.com] and create a new project:

You will also need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials for the project since Google does not do that automatically. From the sidebar, click the `Credentials` tab, the click `Create credentials` and choose `OAuth client ID` from the dropdown.

The Google Console will prompt for some information about your application such as the product name, a home page and a logo. On the next page, select *Web Application* type, and enter the redirect URL where the Micronaut app we will build next will wait for the callback.

You will then receive a client ID and secret.

To use OAuth 2.0 integration in your Micronaut App, add the next dependency:

[source,java]
.gradle.properties
----
include::{sourceDir}/gradle.properties[]
----
[source,java]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
  ...
  ..
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=oauth2]
}
----

Add also JWT https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#jwt[Micronaut’s JWT support] dependencies:

[source,java]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
  ...
  ..
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=jwt]
}
----


Add the following Oauth2 Configuration:

[source,java]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=oauth2]
----

<1> Enable security
<2> The provider identifier should match the last part of the url you entered as a redirect url `/oauth/callback/google`
<3> Client Secret. See previous screenshot.
<4> Client ID. See previous screenshot.
<5> `issuer` url. It allows micronaut to discover the configuration of the OpenID Connect server.
<6> ID Token is a JWT token. We need to enable https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html#jwt[Micronaut’s JWT support] to validate it.
<7> Once validated, we are going to save the ID Token in a Cookie. To read in subsequent requests, enable https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html#cookieToken[Cookie Token Reader].
<8> You can create a http://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/signature/secret/SecretSignatureConfiguration.html[SecretSignatureConfiguration] named generator via configuration as illustrated above. The generator signature is used to sign the issued JWT claims.
<9> Change this by your own secret and keep it safe (do not store this in your VCS)
<10> Enable https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/index.html#logout#logout[Logout Controller]
<11> Accept GET request to the `/logout` endpoint.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders. You will need to setup `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OIDC_ISSUER_DOMAIN` and `OIDC_ISSUER_AUTHSERVERID` environment variables.

[soruce, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY
----

We want to use an **Authorization Code** grant type flow which it is described in the following diagram:
