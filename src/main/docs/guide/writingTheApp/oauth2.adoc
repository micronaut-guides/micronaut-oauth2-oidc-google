Visit https://console.developers.google.com[https://console.developers.google.com] and create a new project:

You will also need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials for the project since Google does not do that automatically. From the sidebar, click the `Credentials` tab, the click `Create credentials` and choose `OAuth client ID` from the dropdown.

The Google Console will prompt for some information about your application such as the product name, a home page and a logo. On the next page, select *Web Application* type, and enter the redirect URL where the Micronaut app we will build next will wait for the callback.

You will then receive a client ID and secret.

To use OAuth 2.0 integration in your Micronaut App, add the next dependency:

[source,java]
.gradle.properties
----
include::{sourceDir}/gradle.properties[]
----
[source,java]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
  ...
  ..
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=oauth2]
}
----

Add also JWT https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#jwt[Micronautâ€™s JWT support] dependencies:

[source,java]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
  ...
  ..
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=jwt]
}
----


Add the following Oauth2 Configuration:

[source,java]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=oauth2]
----

<1> Set `micronaut.security.authentication` as `idtoken`. The idtoken provided by Google when the OAuth 2.0 Authorization code flow ends will be saved in a cookie. The id token is a signed JWT. For every request, Micronaut extracts the JWT from the Cookie and validates the JWT signature with the remote Json Web Key Set exposed by Google. JWKS is exposed by Google via the `jws-uri` entry of https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
<2> Client Secret. See previous screenshot.
<3> Client ID. See previous screenshot.
<4> `issuer` url. It allows micronaut to discover the configuration of the OpenID Connect server.
<5> Accept GET request to the `/logout` endpoint.

The previous configuration uses several placeholders. You will need to setup `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

[soruce, bash]
----
export OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
export OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYY
----

Check Google https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration[.well-known/openid-configuration documentation].

We want to use an **Authorization Code** grant type flow which it is described in the following diagram:
